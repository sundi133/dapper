## 🎯 What is Dapper?

Dapper is an AI pentester that delivers actual exploits, not just alerts.

Dapper's goal is to break your web app before someone else does. It autonomously hunts for attack vectors in your code, then uses its built-in browser to execute real exploits, such as injection attacks, and auth bypass, to prove the vulnerability is actually exploitable.

**What Problem Does Dapper Solve?**

Thanks to tools like Claude Code and Cursor, your team ships code non-stop. But your penetration test? That happens once a year. This creates a *massive* security gap. For the other 364 days, you could be unknowingly shipping vulnerabilities to production.

Dapper closes this gap by acting as your on-demand whitebox pentester. It doesn't just find potential issues. It executes real exploits, providing concrete proof of vulnerabilities. This lets you ship with confidence, knowing every build can be secured.


## ✨ Features

- **Fully Autonomous Operation**: Launch the pentest with a single command. The AI handles everything from advanced 2FA/TOTP logins (including sign in with Google) and browser navigation to the final report with zero intervention.
- **Pentester-Grade Reports with Reproducible Exploits**: Delivers a final report focused on proven, exploitable findings, complete with copy-and-paste Proof-of-Concepts to eliminate false positives and provide actionable results.
- **Critical OWASP Vulnerability Coverage**: Currently identifies and validates the following critical vulnerabilities: Injection, XSS, SSRF, and Broken Authentication/Authorization, with more types in development.
- **Code-Aware Dynamic Testing**: Analyzes your source code to intelligently guide its attack strategy, then performs live, browser and command line based exploits on the running application to confirm real-world risk.
- **Powered by Integrated Security Tools**: Enhances its discovery phase by leveraging leading reconnaissance and testing tools—including **Nmap, Subfinder, WhatWeb, and Schemathesis**—for deep analysis of the target environment.
- **Parallel Processing for Faster Results**: Get your report faster. The system parallelizes the most time-intensive phases, running analysis and exploitation for all vulnerability types concurrently.

## 🚀 Setup & Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** - Container runtime ([Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
- **AI Provider Credentials** (choose one):
  - **Anthropic API key** (recommended) - Get from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com)
  - **Claude Code OAuth token**
  - **[EXPERIMENTAL - UNSUPPORTED] Alternative providers via Router Mode** - OpenAI or Google Gemini via OpenRouter (see [Router Mode](#experimental---unsupported-router-mode-alternative-providers))

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone Dapper
git clone https://github.com/sundi133/dapper.git
cd dapper

# 2. Configure credentials (choose one method)

# Option A: Export environment variables
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"              # or CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN

# Option B: Create a .env file
cat > .env << 'EOF'
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
EOF

# 3. Run a pentest
./dapper start URL=https://your-app.com REPO=your-repo
```

Dapper will build the containers, start the workflow, and return a workflow ID. The pentest runs in the background.

### Monitoring Progress

```bash
# View real-time worker logs
./dapper logs

# Query a specific workflow's progress
./dapper query ID=dapper-1234567890

# Open the Temporal Web UI for detailed monitoring
open http://localhost:8233
```

### Stopping Dapper

```bash
# Stop all containers (preserves workflow data)
./dapper stop

# Full cleanup (removes all data)
./dapper stop CLEAN=true
```

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic pentest
./dapper start URL=https://example.com REPO=repo-name

# With a configuration file
./dapper start URL=https://example.com REPO=repo-name CONFIG=./configs/my-config.yaml

# Custom output directory
./dapper start URL=https://example.com REPO=repo-name OUTPUT=./my-reports
```

### Prepare Your Repository

Dapper expects target repositories to be placed under the `./repos/` directory at the project root. The `REPO` flag refers to a folder name inside `./repos/`. Copy the repository you want to scan into `./repos/`, or clone it directly there:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git ./repos/your-repo
```

**For monorepos:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-monorepo.git ./repos/your-monorepo
```

**For multi-repository applications** (e.g., separate frontend/backend):

```bash
mkdir ./repos/your-app
cd ./repos/your-app
git clone https://github.com/your-org/frontend.git
git clone https://github.com/your-org/backend.git
git clone https://github.com/your-org/api.git
```

### Platform-Specific Instructions

**For Linux (Native Docker):**

You may need to run commands with `sudo` depending on your Docker setup. If you encounter permission issues with output files, ensure your user has access to the Docker socket.

**For macOS:**

Works out of the box with Docker Desktop installed.

**Testing Local Applications:**

Docker containers cannot reach `localhost` on your host machine. Use `host.docker.internal` in place of `localhost`:

```bash
./dapper start URL=http://host.docker.internal:3000 REPO=repo-name
```

### Configuration (Optional)

While you can run without a config file, creating one enables authenticated testing and customized analysis. Place your configuration files inside the `./configs/` directory — this folder is mounted into the Docker container automatically.

#### Create Configuration File

Copy and modify the example configuration:

```bash
cp configs/example-config.yaml configs/my-app-config.yaml
```

#### Basic Configuration Structure

```yaml
authentication:
  login_type: form
  login_url: "https://your-app.com/login"
  credentials:
    username: "test@example.com"
    password: "yourpassword"
    totp_secret: "LB2E2RX7XFHSTGCK"  # Optional for 2FA

  login_flow:
    - "Type $username into the email field"
    - "Type $password into the password field"
    - "Click the 'Sign In' button"

  success_condition:
    type: url_contains
    value: "/dashboard"

rules:
  avoid:
    - description: "AI should avoid testing logout functionality"
      type: path
      url_path: "/logout"

  focus:
    - description: "AI should emphasize testing API endpoints"
      type: path
      url_path: "/api"
```

#### TOTP Setup for 2FA

If your application uses two-factor authentication, simply add the TOTP secret to your config file. The AI will automatically generate the required codes during testing.

### [EXPERIMENTAL - UNSUPPORTED] Router Mode (Alternative Providers)

Dapper can experimentally route requests through alternative AI providers using claude-code-router. This mode is not officially supported and is intended primarily for:

* **Model experimentation** — try Dapper with GPT-5.2 or Gemini 3–family models

#### Quick Setup

1. Add your provider API key to `.env`:

```bash
# Choose one provider:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# OR
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...

# Set default model:
ROUTER_DEFAULT=openai,gpt-5.2  # provider,model format
```

2. Run with `ROUTER=true`:

```bash
./dapper start URL=https://example.com REPO=repo-name ROUTER=true
```

#### Experimental Models

| Provider | Models |
|----------|--------|
| OpenAI | gpt-5.2, gpt-5-mini |
| OpenRouter | google/gemini-3-flash-preview |

#### Disclaimer

This feature is experimental and unsupported. Output quality depends heavily on the model. Dapper is built on top of the Anthropic Agent SDK and is optimized and primarily tested with Anthropic Claude models. Alternative providers may produce inconsistent results (including failing early phases like Recon) depending on the model and routing setup.

### Output and Results

All results are saved to `./audit-logs/{hostname}_{sessionId}/` by default. Use `--output <path>` to specify a custom directory.

Output structure:
```
audit-logs/{hostname}_{sessionId}/
├── session.json          # Metrics and session data
├── agents/               # Per-agent execution logs
├── prompts/              # Prompt snapshots for reproducibility
└── deliverables/
    └── comprehensive_security_assessment_report.md   # Final comprehensive security report
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

Dapper emulates a human penetration tester's methodology using a sophisticated multi-agent architecture. It combines white-box source code analysis with black-box dynamic exploitation across four distinct phases:

```

### Architectural Overview

Dapper is engineered to emulate the methodology of a human penetration tester. It leverages Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK as its core reasoning engine, but its true strength lies in the sophisticated multi-agent architecture built around it. This architecture combines the deep context of **white-box source code analysis** with the real-world validation of **black-box dynamic exploitation**, managed by an orchestrator through four distinct phases to ensure a focus on minimal false positives and intelligent context management.

---

#### **Phase 1: Reconnaissance**

The first phase builds a comprehensive map of the application's attack surface. Dapper analyzes the source code and integrates with tools like Nmap and Subfinder to understand the tech stack and infrastructure. Simultaneously, it performs live application exploration via browser automation to correlate code-level insights with real-world behavior, producing a detailed map of all entry points, API endpoints, and authentication mechanisms for the next phase.

#### **Phase 2: Vulnerability Analysis**

To maximize efficiency, this phase operates in parallel. Using the reconnaissance data, specialized agents for each OWASP category hunt for potential flaws in parallel. For vulnerabilities like Injection and SSRF, agents perform a structured data flow analysis, tracing user input to dangerous sinks. This phase produces a key deliverable: a list of **hypothesized exploitable paths** that are passed on for validation.

#### **Phase 3: Exploitation**

Continuing the parallel workflow to maintain speed, this phase is dedicated entirely to turning hypotheses into proof. Dedicated exploit agents receive the hypothesized paths and attempt to execute real-world attacks using browser automation, command-line tools, and custom scripts. This phase enforces a strict **"No Exploit, No Report"** policy: if a hypothesis cannot be successfully exploited to demonstrate impact, it is discarded as a false positive.

#### **Phase 4: Reporting**

The final phase compiles all validated findings into a professional, actionable report. An agent consolidates the reconnaissance data and the successful exploit evidence, cleaning up any noise or hallucinated artifacts. Only verified vulnerabilities are included, complete with **reproducible, copy-and-paste Proof-of-Concepts**, delivering a final pentest-grade report focused exclusively on proven risks.


## 📋 Coverage and Roadmap

For detailed information about Dapper's security testing coverage and development roadmap, see our [Coverage and Roadmap](./COVERAGE.md) documentation.

## ⚠️ Disclaimers

### Important Usage Guidelines & Disclaimers

Please review the following guidelines carefully before using Dapper (Lite). As a user, you are responsible for your actions and assume all liability.

#### **1. Potential for Mutative Effects & Environment Selection**

This is not a passive scanner. The exploitation agents are designed to **actively execute attacks** to confirm vulnerabilities. This process can have mutative effects on the target application and its data.

> [!WARNING]
> **⚠️ DO NOT run Dapper on production environments.**
>
> - It is intended exclusively for use on sandboxed, staging, or local development environments where data integrity is not a concern.
> - Potential mutative effects include, but are not limited to: creating new users, modifying or deleting data, compromising test accounts, and triggering unintended side effects from injection attacks.

#### **2. Legal & Ethical Use**

Dapper is designed for legitimate security auditing purposes only.

#### **3. LLM & Automation Caveats**

- **Verification is Required**: While significant engineering has gone into our "proof-by-exploitation" methodology to eliminate false positives, the underlying LLMs can still generate hallucinated or weakly-supported content in the final report. **Human oversight is essential** to validate the legitimacy and severity of all reported findings.
- **Comprehensiveness**: The analysis in Dapper Lite may not be exhaustive due to the inherent limitations of LLM context windows. For a more comprehensive, graph-based analysis of your entire codebase, **Dapper Pro** leverages its advanced data flow analysis engine to ensure deeper and more thorough coverage.

#### **4. Scope of Analysis**

- **Targeted Vulnerabilities**: The current version of Dapper Lite specifically targets the following classes of *exploitable* vulnerabilities:
  - Broken Authentication & Authorization
  - Injection
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- **What Dapper Lite Does Not Cover**: This list is not exhaustive of all potential security risks. Dapper Lite's "proof-by-exploitation" model means it will not report on issues it cannot actively exploit, such as vulnerable third-party libraries or insecure configurations. These types of deep static-analysis findings are a core focus of the advanced analysis engine in **Dapper Pro**.

#### **5. Cost & Performance**

- **Time**: As of the current version, a full test run typically takes **1 to 1.5 hours** to complete.
- **Cost**: Running the full test using Anthropic's Claude 4.5 Sonnet model may incur costs of approximately **$50 USD**. Costs vary based on model pricing and application complexity.

#### **6. Windows Antivirus False Positives**

Windows Defender may flag files in `xben-benchmark-results/` or `deliverables/` as malware. These are false positives caused by exploit code in the reports. Add an exclusion for the Dapper directory in Windows Defender, or use Docker/WSL2.


## 📜 License

Dapper Lite is released under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)](LICENSE).

Dapper is open source (AGPL v3). This license allows you to:
- Use it freely for all internal security testing.
- Modify the code privately for internal use without sharing your changes.

The AGPL's sharing requirements primarily apply to organizations offering Dapper as a public or managed service (such as a SaaS platform). In those specific cases, any modifications made to the core software must be open-sourced.
